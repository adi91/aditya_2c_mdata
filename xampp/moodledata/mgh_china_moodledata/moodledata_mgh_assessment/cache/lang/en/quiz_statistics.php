Our equation for effective question weight cannot be calculated in this case. The calculations for effective question weight for other questions in this test are the effective question weight for these questions if the highlighted questions with a negative covariance are given a maximum grade of zero.

If you edit a test and give these question(s) with negative covariance a max grade of zero then the effective question weight of these questions will be zero and the real effective question weight of other questions will be as calculated now.',
